# Jokebot

* **Author**: Paul Shao
* **Description**: A mini-chatbot capable of telling jokes either by using a local `.csv` file with the jokes or fetching from Reddit posts.
* **Usage**: Within the directory of `Jokebot.py`, enter the command `python Jokebot.py <csv file name>` to start the bot.
Note: the argument `<csv file name>` is completely optional; you can opt out to directly use the fetch-from-Reddit functionality.

## All Files and Functionalities:
* `Jokebot.py`: Main Script for Running Jokebot.
* `Utils.py`: Hosts Util Methods Used in Fetching Data, Handling Exceptions, and Reading CSV and Input.
* `Fetch.py`: Main Script for Fetching Posts from Reddit and Format Them into CSV File Format.
